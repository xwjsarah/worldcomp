	 <em>Search for Extraterrestrial Life in our Solar System</em><br>
     Dr. Firouz Naderi<br>
     Dr. Naderi is the former director of Solar System Exploration at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) 
	 where he oversaw robotic spacecraft dispatched to all corners of the solar system to discover how it formed and evolved, and how we came to be.
     Prior to that he was NASA’s Program Manager for Mars Exploration at the time of the twin Mars Rovers landings and for 
	 several years he served as the senior strategic officer for JPL. His experience is in large complex program and project management.
     Currently he serves as coach, advisor, and strategists for a number of startup companies
     He has been elected a Fellow of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and is the recipient of several awards for
	 outstanding contributions to space science and technology. These include: NASA’s outstanding Leadership Medal, Ellis Island Medal of 
	 Honor, Technology Hall of Fame Medal, and NASA’s highest award: Distinguished Service Medal.

	 <em>Data Science for High Dimensional Datasets</em><br>
     Prof. Alfred Inselberg <br>
     AIfred received a Ph. D. in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Illinois (Champaign-Urbana) and stayed on as Research Professor. 
	 He then held senior research positions at IBM, where he developed a Mathematical Model of Ear (TIME Nov. 74), concurrently having joint 
	 appointments at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), University of Southern California (USC), Technion and Ben Gurion Universities. 
	 Since 1995 he is Professor at the School of Mathematical Sciences of Tel Aviv University. AI was elected Senior Fellow at the San Diego 
	 Supercomputing Center in 1996 and Distinguished Visiting Professor at Korea University in Seoul in 2008, and National University of Singapore 2011. 
	 He invented and developed the multidimensional system of Parallel Coordinates for which he received numerous awards and patents 
	 (on Air Traffic Control, Collision-Avoidance, Computer Vision, Data Mining). His textbook on "Parallel Coordinates: 
	 VISUAL Multidimensional Geometry", Springer 2009, was praised by Stephen Hawking among many others.
